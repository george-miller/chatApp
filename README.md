# Chat App

This is a simple app I created with node.js and socket.io.  It is live [here](http://georgemyersmiller.com/node/).  I manage this app on my server with [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

# How to run it on your local computer
You have to [install Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows) and install MongoDB.

Use ```npm install``` from the root of this repo's directory.

Then from the terminal use the command: ```node app.js``` and point your browser at http://localhost:3000.
